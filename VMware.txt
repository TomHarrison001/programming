Virtualisation - virtual machines used to run multiple OSs and apps
Bare-metal server - a physical server without an OS
Hypervisor - a host or virtual server
Virtual machine (VM) - a guest or instance
Virtualisation manager: vCenter, Oracle VM Manager
Virtual desktop - Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)
P2V - physical to virtual
V2V - virtual to virtual
VM template - used to create multiple instances
Snapshot - almost a backup of the VM setup however its not because it's stored on the same disk space as their parent VM
Clone - clone of a VM

Virtualistaion is a software technology whereas cloud is a remote location which utilises virtualisation technology. Private cloud is a type of cloud computing that can be implemented using a proprietary architecture.

VMware virtualisation software is called ESXi (hypvervisor)
Other virtualisation companies:
Microsoft (Hyper-V)
Oracle (OVM/OLVM)
Citric (XenServer)
Red Hat (KVM)
IBM

VMware Workstation Player - runs VMs on Windows, Linux or macOS
VMware vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi) - bare-metal hypervisor (installs directly onto your physical server)
VMware vSphere Client - interface that allows you to connect to a hypervisor (client just lilke RDP for Windows or PuTTY for Linux servers)
VMware vCenter - manages multiple hypervisors (vSphere Client with added functionality)

# Download and Install VMware Workstation Player
# Download vSphere ESXi version 7.x
# Create a new VM: 4GB RAM, 2 CPU, 100GB min free disk space
# Attach the ESXi ISO image
# After setup, access the vm through your browser with the ip given

# Access ESXi through SSH
Browser > Host > Actions > Services > Enable SSH
